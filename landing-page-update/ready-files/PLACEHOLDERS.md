# Replacing the Placeholder Artwork

**Status (2026-10-19, updated):** all placeholders are replaced. The gallery
now carries 7 original AVP works — hero: Cosmic Phoenix Ascending; works:
Beneath the Red Moon, The Screaming Void, Cosmic Phoenix Ascending (wide),
Beyond Form, The Black Beacon, Apex in the Rain, From Above — No. 03.
Keep this guide for adding future pieces.

Everything visual still flagged below is a **stand-in**. All artwork, titles, tags
and alt text are meant to be swapped for your real portfolio pieces.

## Where things live

| Social links (ArtStation / Instagram / X) | `index.html` → footer “Elsewhere” column |

## Swapping a piece (per work)

1. Drop your image into `assets/img/` using the same naming pattern, e.g.
   `work-05-your-title.jpg`. Tip: export around 1600–2000 px on the long edge,
   JPG quality ~80.
2. In `index.html`, find that work’s block (each one is marked
   `░░ WORK 0X — REPLACE ME ░░` with a comment above it).
3. Update:
   - `<img src="assets/img/...">` → your file
   - `alt` → describe your real artwork
   - `<h3 class="work-title">` → your title
   - `<span class="work-kind">` → its category (e.g. `Dark Fantasy · Character`)
   - the `data-title` attribute on the `<figure>` (used by the lightbox caption)
4. Delete the `<span class="placeholder-flag">Replace Me</span>` line and the
   `<p class="work-note">` line for that piece — those are only placeholder cues.
5. Update the caption text inside the figure — the lightbox reuses it
   automatically.

## Layout roles (keep art dominant)

The gallery is built from three row types inside `.works-grid`:

- `.works-row` — a pair: `.work-tall` (dominant 7fr slot) + `.work-lean`
  (5fr companion slot). Frames share one height so bottoms always align.
- `.works-row.flip` — the mirrored pair (lean slot first, tall slot second).
- `.work-wide` — full-width cinematic slot for wide key art (21:9 crop).

Current rhythm: **pair → wide → flipped pair → pair** (7 pieces). Add a new work by
copying any `figure.work` block into a row — or add a whole new
`<div class="works-row">` with two figures. Grid, hover treatment and the
lightbox pick it up automatically. Portrait crops suit the tall/lean slots;
wide landscape art suits `.work-wide`.

## Also replace when ready

- Favicon (currently an inline SVG monogram in `<head>`)
- `mailto:` placeholder address in the Contact section
- Social links in the footer (currently `href="#"`)
